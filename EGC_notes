11/11/24 Trying Code 

-Need to run every time: Pull any changes from Github
cd /uufs/chpc.utah.edu/common/home/saarman-group1/cx_ddRAD_scripts/
git pull


* fatal: detected dubious ownership in repository at '/uufs/chpc.utah.edu/common/home/saarman-group1/cx_ddRAD_scripts'
To add an exception for this directory, call:
        git config --global --add safe.directory /uufs/chpc.utah.edu/common/home/saarman-group1/cx_ddRAD_scripts
[u1055819@frisco1 cx_ddRAD_scripts]$ 


*Can't pull from github so the slurm files I have in CHPC are older still have bee information... I could manually change them in interactive session?


12/6/24

Made file for barcodes and original IDs for each sample. Only 95 in the example, so had to add my last sample in manually (agctaaga+C	CB01-I repeated from first plate)

*Using terminal on my mac? Was going to try the CHPC but that wasnt working at first, will try again. 
Going through README file trying to git pull into Cx_ddRAD scripts directory
